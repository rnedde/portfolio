				<div class = "col-sm-8 mx-auto p-1">
				<p>I created this artwork as a way to continue to intertwine my experience as a synchronized swimmer with my artistic practice, displaying my sport in a new context. I chose this view as a way to see it in a new perspective, showcasing the duality of our craft, requiring effortless grace and great strength at the exact same time. I wanted to create something that people haven’t seen before, and maybe most people wouldn’t think to try. It is a technique that at its core is quite absurd, since printmaking and animation are both long, tedious processes. But isn’t growing as an artist, a swimmer, and a person a long and tedious process as well?</p>

					<h2 class = "display-6">Video</h2>
					<p>I took two videos of a partner lift at the same time, one above water with an iPhone, and one below water with a gopro. I edited the two videos together to make it seamless, and used this video as my reference when making my linomation. The video is of me pushing my teammate Hannah out of the water. </p>
					<h2 class = "display-6">Rotoscoping</h2>
					<p>I then brought this video into photoshop, where I was able to trace over the figures frame by frame so it would be easier to see when I traced it onto my linoleum blocks later. I made 40 frames, but later edited it down to 36. </p>
					<h2 class = "display-6">Tracing</h2>
					<p>I printed out all of the frames from photoshop to be 4x6 to match the size of the blocks I cut. I used vine charcoal on the backs of the papers and a sharp pen to transfer the images to my blocks. </p>
					<h2 class = "display-6">Carving</h2>
					<p>I started by carving out the underwater part, because I was sure that I wanted it to be white on black. I still wasn't sure if I wanted to commit to carving out all of the negative space on the top, but when it came time to make a decision I thought that it would be worth it in the end. To save time, for some of the blocks I cut off the larger parts with negative space rather than carving out the entire thing. It also allows me to reuse the pieces I cut off for future projects. This was by far the most time consuming and labor intensive part of the process.</p>
					<h2 class = "display-6">Printing</h2>
					<p>I used the OSU print shop to print all of my blocks. The end was in sight, and I eventually got into a good rhythm and printed them all in one day. This was probably my favorite part of the process because it was exciting to see it all start to come together. </p>
					<h2 class = "display-6">Assembling</h2>
					<p>I scanned in all of my finished prints and assembled them in After Effects. I made tiny tweaks to the positioning of all of the frames so they lined up perfectly, and the finished video was as smooth as possible. I played around with the frame rate, and settled on 12 and 8 fps. </p>
